# Intro to pytorch

The material in this repository is based on the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). In the `tensors.ipynb` notebook, ChatGPT has helped with a few example code chunks and summarization for broadcasting rules :wink:.

As you already know, python has libraries for nearly all tasks. For machine learning, the two most popular ones are [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Even though TensorFlow may be a little easier to start with, PyTorch offers more flexibility, which is why we like to work with it.

We will introduce you to `Tensors` and `Modules`, which are the base for all the helpful neural network building blocks in PyTorch. We will also show you how to prepare data for neural network training and how to build a simple network.

The notebooks are supposed to be used in the format of a course and will soon receive some exercises, too. You can find the teaching material in the notebooks folder and should go through in the indicated order:

### Tensors

### Modules

### Datasets and Dataloaders

### A simple Neural Network
